## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
By solving this challenge i somewhat sharpened my CSS flexbox skills as the solution has been created predominantly by using flexbox.


### Continued development
I would like to continue and focus on utilizing flexbox in other problems as it is an efficient way to lay out items on the screen. Similarly I would also like to spend some more time with CSS frameworks like bootstrap and bulma.

### Useful resources
- [The web devleoper bootcamp by Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) - This course is the only thing you need if you are interested in entering the world of web development. All my learnings of CSS, HTML and JS came from this course though I have not completed the course as of now.
